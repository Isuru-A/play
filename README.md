# Nonverse Network
To report an issue click [**here**](https://github.com/nonverse/play/issues/new/choose)

### **SERVER QUEUE WORKER IS CURRENTLY PAUSED**
- Daily backups will not take place
- Server restarts will not take place so some lag is to be expected
- Core protect data will not be purged at the end of the week

### **You must be already registered via the [Nonverse Members App](https://my.nonverse.net) to play on Nonverse Minecraft servers.**

Once you have successfully registered and linked your minecraft profile you will be required to login each time you commence a new session.

**Server Address** ```play.nonverse.net```

**Server Port** ```25565``` (Default)

**Login In Game Using** ```/login <Your  Password Here>```

## In Game Sessions
A new session will be created each time you login in game using your password. You will be automatically logged out of the in game session after 60 seconds of disconnection

- Sessions are persistent throughout servers and you will only be asked to login if the server is unable to find an existing session. Usually this is **each time you login**.
- Users are required to login within 60 seconds of connecting before they are kicked. **This timer does not apply if you are connected to link your account**
- Your currently active session can be revoked anytime using ```/logout```. **This will prompt you to login again before kicking you after 60 seconds**

**In game sessions are different to web sessions which are used to authenticate your identity accross Nonverse web apps**. In game sessions are not used and are invalid outside of Minecraft

## AFK (Away From Keyboard) or Idle Users
To ensure fairness of play and high server performance, players are put into AFK mode after 60 seconds of inactivity. Players in AFK mode will be kicked after a further 60 seconds
- Players will be warned that they have been put into AFK mode before they are eventually kicked
- During AFK mode users are unaffected by damage and commands of any sort unless issued by the server or a player with admin privileges.
- Players can manually enter AFK mode by using ```/afk```
- **To exit AFK mode simply interact with the world in any way** or by using ```/afk```

**AFK MODE IS DIFFERENT TO BEING FROZEN** - Players can only be frozen or unfrozen by admins or by the server if there are any suspicious of unfair play
